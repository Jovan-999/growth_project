            Yes, it works in any industry, no matter how boring or vanilla it
            might be.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            In this post, I will outline the strategy as well as demonstrate the
            results we achieved with our Trojan Horse strategy across multiple
            industries with varying amplification methods and ad spends from
            $10k per month to over 100k per month.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">1184 bc</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Homers Iliad tells us of a great war, between the Trojans and
            Greeks, sparked by Trojan prince Paris abducting and marrying Helen,
            wife of a Spartan king.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            The Greeks terrorized the countryside for years but couldnt conquer
            the city of Troy. Finally, the Greeks built the Trojan Horse and
            faked sailing away.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            The Trojan Horse was filled with Greek soldiers but presented as a
            gift to the city of Troy. As the city celebrated their “victory” the
            Greeks left their hiding spot inside of the giant horse and opened
            the gates for their fellow soldiers that sailed back under the
            shroud of nightfall.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">The city fell.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Now, staunch historians see this as a story rather than a historic
            war strategy, but this concept can make your business a tremendous
            amount of money.

            You see, when focusing on inbound marketing, your only focus needs
            to be on crafting your pages conversion elements, your message, etc.
            People are coming to you and seeking out an answer to a query or a
            solution for a specific problem.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Building an inbound strategy is essential, but when it comes time to
            really get yourselves out there and market your offer, you need to
            position your interruptive marketing in a way that builds trust and
            drives sales.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">Thus, the Trojan Horse.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            I am going to detail out some of the exact Trojan Horse strategies
            we have used for our clients and the results we brought. I will also
            give some examples that even in the most obscure b2b niches, we can
            build rapport and slide right into their good graces.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Like the Greeks, we are going to use a “gift” or an “offering of
            value” to get past the city gates.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Once we are inside (they accept the gift) the piece of value not
            only works as an active piece of marketing, but we also received
            that first “handshake” so we can continue the conversation with
            them.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">Example:</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            An example, from our SaaS marketing case study, is Local Viking and
            the Trojan Horse we built for them.
          </p>
          <img class="table" src="images/table.png" alt="Table" />
          <img class="table--second" src="images/table2.png" alt="Table" />
          <p class="primary__text">
            This is not the most mature Trojan Horse capaign we have
          </p>
          <img class="toolbox" src="images/toolbox.png" alt="Toolbox" />
          <p class="primary__text">
            At the moment it is producing sub-four dollar leads, handshakes with
            agencies in LVs target market that are saying, "YES! This will
            provide value to us. Lets shake hands and give me the info"
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">This campaign is a complete machine</p>
          <img class="guide" src="images/guide.png" alt="guide" />
          <p class="primary__text">
            A very simple front end for cold traffic, a guide, allows us to
            lower our audiences guard and allow us in
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">Look at those lead numbers.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            For pennies, we are getting leads into our system that are being
            sold products and interacting with our clients brand.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Another brand we work on, this one providing a grab bag of Trojan
            Horse potential enjoys a 12x+ ROAS (return on ad spend).
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">They spend $1.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">They spend $12.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Recently we developed a game plan that included using a Trojan Horse
            to get businesses interested in a client of ours.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Our client is in pharmaceutical distribution so they are targeting
            pharmacies. Our USP is getting the same brand of product you
            currently stock but at prices up to 50% cheaper.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            So, we hit the whiteboard and started brainstorming how we can kill
            a few birds with one stone.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Goal: We wanted to accomplish the following things
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Get in front of decision-makers at pharmacies
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Get their information so we can continue to market to them and push
            them closer to the sale Have whatever we use to get in front of them
            act as an additional tool to trigger a purchase or at least consider
            one.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Provide a ton of value so we build goodwill We ended up designing a
            white paper on “Strategies to Increase Pharmacy Profits and Revenue”
            that we could market to the decision-makers at a pharmacy. One of
            the first points was of course looking to cut costs on their stocked
            medication by sourcing from cheaper companies.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Of course, we required an opt-in to get the white paper so we now
            have the contact info for the person at the pharmacist that we can
            communicate with to push them deeper into our conversion process.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Please note, this was not a quick, sloppy piece of content we put
            together just to snag downloads.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            It was very well researched and provided a lot of value for the
            end-user. We did not give simple tips like “market yourself locally”
            or “create relationships with Dr.s”. Keep that in mind when
            developing assets for your content marketing, take the time or make
            the investment in quality.
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">Provide real value.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">Its a very simple process.</p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            We skip the cold outreach altogether and create a handshake
          </p>
          <p class="primary__text">
            Create an asset that you can have someone download or text/email
            them. Provide real value and create something they will truly
            appreciate. Sprinkle your brand in there and do not be afraid to
            have it almost advertorial like so long as you are really helping
            them out with this content. Use retargeting and email marketing to
            continue pushing them down the path to becoming a customer. It is a
            simple 1-2 punch that has created countless amounts of revenue for
            us and others.
