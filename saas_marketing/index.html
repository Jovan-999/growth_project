            Marketing Like a Pro

          <p class="box__text">
            Typically content marketing is an overused buzzword that gets
            applied to a simple blog post made every month because Google told
            you that good content matters. That statement being reiterated time
            and time again has led to more thoughtless blog posts created than
            anything has or ever will in the history of the internet.
          </p>
          <p class="box__text">
            Our content marketing includes an ideation process for blog post
            creation but a smart content plan goes above and beyond. We work
            with your team to create pillar pieces of content. Downloads, lead
            magnets, items that can be used for order bumps.
          </p>
          <p class="box__text">
            We ideate what content we can create that increases retention, helps
            users with use cases, and offers information that might interest
            potential users based on our customer avatar. We help you plan and
            create content for every step of the purchasing journey.

            SaaS SEO: Because the Content<br />
            Won’t Promote Itself
          </h4>
          <p class="box__text">
            Having amazing content and funnels to make people aware of your
            brand and drive them deeper down the conversion path is important
            but what if no one sees them? We remove that possibility through
            amplifying the content with media buying as well as SEO.
          </p>
          <p class="box__text">
            SEO is one of the best long term investments you will make in your
            brand. Our first step is to run a several hundred point audit that
            encompasses technical issues, content gaps and optimization, as well
            as current link deficiencies based on competitor parity. Our
            relationships with journalists, bloggers, and influencers help
            amplify your content and our white hat link acquisition strategy
            ensures your organic growth increases in a safe and evergreen
            manner.
