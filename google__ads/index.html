            Most agencies strive to provide the minimum needed satisfaction to
            their client. The minimum effort required to ensure the monthly
            billing continues and the client touchpoints are low. They follow
            this trend for 6 months or 9 months, however long it takes for the
            client to realize they could be doing better so they shop around and
            switch companies.

          <p class="last__text">
            Our philosophy is to invest heavily into our client campaigns and
            ensure their ROI because most of our engagements last for multiple
            years. We have clients that have been on board with us for almost a
            decade. That’s where we achieve maximum profitability, from multiple
            year engagements.

            Do you care how much a click costs? Maybe. What if your cheapest
            clicks are your most expensive customers to convert? What if they
            have the largest churn percentage out of any marketing channel? How
            would we feel if you are not profitable at all even though the front
            end vanity metrics look good?

            Our world class reporting allows us to integrate and track multiple

            macro conversions so we can use that to constantly optimize and
            improve.

          <p class="last__text">
            When we sit down to discuss your campaign performance we won’t
            forget to report your cost per clicks and other metrics that most
            certainly can be important, but we also will work with your company
            to track the macro KPIs that determine true profitability on each ad
            set.
