              which allows us to consistently drive an ROI from our ad
              management endeavors. Managing tens of millions of dollars in ad

            This is where ad groups are made in clusters of four with each of
            them containing four ad variations. This allows us to find winners
            exponentially faster without slowly testing and bleeding ad budget
            for months before discovering the winners. We move fast. You will
            never bleed marketing dollars with us. We market our own services
            and businesses and treat yours like ours. No wasted spend, only ROI
            positive activities.
